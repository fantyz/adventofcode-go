# Advent of Code

This repository contains my solutions for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) puzzles implemented in Go.

Do not that everything prior to 2020 is currently in a somewhat messy state. These were quick and dirty solutions that were not written with anything other than solving the puzzle in mind. A lot of days are missing as well due to lack of time over the holidays. I do plan to go over the previous years and rewrite them into more presentable solutions, but this might take a while to get around to doing.

## Favorite Puzzles

Some puzzles are just more fun to solve than others. These are the most memorable ones:

* [2020 - Day 8: Handheld Halting](2020/08.go): Debugging a BoodCode program.
* [2020 - Day 13: Shuttle Search](2020/13.go): Finding patterns in bus schedules.
* [2020 - Day 20: Jurassic Jigsaw](2020/20.go): Automated jigsaw solving and monster hunting.

## TODO

* Find old favorite days and add to section above
* Clean the code up and make it properly readable
* Solve the missing puzzles
